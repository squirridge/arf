# ARF, Amber Research Format
## From SquirrelRidge.org

## Use Cases
### Preserved_Amber
Link rot looms large with a range of nearly-lost information. Though it persists in archival form, the compute-intensive mirroring and data-intensive loading make it difficult
to reliably access and distribute previously completed research.
### WrittenIn_Amber
Scholarship and publications have reached a complex endgame: PDF jail and institutional paygating. What if we built a format for responsive publishing and easy information
structure that can be read by machines and people alike?
